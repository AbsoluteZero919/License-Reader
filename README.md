# License-Reader
This is a project to read a driver's license or RC card, and automate field filling by taking the details from the same.<br>
It is done using Python (Regex) and AWS (Textract).<br>
Many of the older driver's licenses used to have different patterns in different fields as compared to the recent ones.<br> Keeping this in mind, we've covered as many possibilities as possible.
